Service Accounts and Roles: Fundamentals
[https://partner.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/11640?parent=catalog]


&&What are service accounts?

A service account is a special Google account that belongs to your application or a virtual machine (VM) instead of an individual end user. Your application uses the service account to call the Google API of a service, so that the users aren't directly involved.

For example, a Compute Engine VM may run as a service account, and that account can be given permissions to access the resources it needs. This way the service account is the identity of the service, and the service account's permissions control which resources the service can access.

A service account is identified by its email address, which is unique to the account.

Types of service accounts
User-managed service accounts

When you create a new Cloud project using Google Cloud console and if Compute Engine API is enabled for your project, a Compute Engine Service account is created for you by default. It is identifiable using the email:

PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com

If your project contains an App Engine application, the default App Engine service account is created in your project by default. It is identifiable using the email:

PROJECT_ID@appspot.gserviceaccount.com

Google-managed service accounts

In addition to the user-managed service accounts, you might see some additional service accounts in your projectâ€™s IAM policy or in the console. These service accounts are created and owned by Google. These accounts represent different Google services and each account is automatically granted IAM roles to access your Google Cloud project.
Google APIs service account

An example of a Google-managed service account is a Google API service account identifiable using the email:

PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com

This service account is designed specifically to run internal Google processes on your behalf and is not listed in the Service Accounts section of the console. By default, the account is automatically granted the project editor role on the project and is listed in the IAM section of the console. This service account is deleted only when the project is deleted.

Creating and managing service accounts

When you create a new Cloud project, Google Cloud automatically creates one Compute Engine service account and one App Engine service account under that project. You can create up to 98 additional service accounts to your project to control access to your resources.
Creating a service account

Creating a service account is similar to adding a member to your project, but the service account belongs to your applications rather than an individual end user.

    To create a service account, run the following command in Cloud Shell:

*gcloud iam service-accounts create my-sa-123 --display-name "my service account"

The output of this command is the service account, which looks similar to the following:

Created service account [my-sa-123]

Granting roles to service accounts

When granting IAM roles, you can treat a service account either as a resource or as an identity.

Your application uses a service account as an identity to authenticate to Google Cloud services. For example, if you have a Compute Engine Virtual Machine (VM) running as a service account, you can grant the editor role to the service account (the identity) for a project (the resource).

At the same time, you might also want to control who can start the VM. You can do this by granting a user (the identity) the serviceAccountUser role for the service account (the resource).
Granting roles to a service account for specific resources

You grant roles to a service account so that the service account has permission to complete specific actions on the resources in your Cloud Platform project. For example, you might grant the storage.admin role to a service account so that it has control over objects and buckets in Cloud Storage.

    Run the following in Cloud Shell to grant roles to the service account you just made:

*gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID \
    --member serviceAccount:my-sa-123@$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --role roles/editor
    
The output displays a list of roles the service account now has:

bindings:
- members:
  - user:email1@gmail.com
    role: roles/owner
- members:
  - serviceAccount:our-project-123@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  - serviceAccount:123456789012-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
  - serviceAccount:my-sa-123@my-project-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  - user:email3@gmail.com
    role: roles/editor
- members:
  - user:email2@gmail.com
role: roles/viewer

Understanding roles

When an identity calls a Google Cloud API, Google Cloud Identity and Access Management requires that the identity has the appropriate permissions to use the resource. You can grant permissions by granting roles to a user, a group, or a service account.
Types of roles

There are three types of roles in Cloud IAM:

    Primitive roles, which include the Owner, Editor, and Viewer roles that existed prior to the introduction of Cloud IAM.
    Predefined roles, which provide granular access for a specific service and are managed by Google Cloud.
    Custom roles, which provide granular access according to a user-specified list of permissions.

Learn more about roles from the Understanding roles Guide.

Use the client libraries to access BigQuery from a service account

In this section, you query the BigQuery public datasets from an instance with the help of a service account that has the necessary roles.
Create a service account

First create a new service account from the console.

    Go to Navigation menu > IAM & Admin, select Service accounts and click on + Create Service Account.

    Fill necessary details with:

    Service account name: bigquery-qwiklab

    Now click Create and Continue and then add the following roles:

    Role: Bigquery > BigQuery Data Viewer and BigQuery > BigQuery User

Your console should resemble the following:

**create_service_account3.jpg

Create a VM instance

    In the console, go to Compute Engine > VM Instances, and click Create Instance.

    Create your VM with the following information:

**create_service_account2.jpg



    Click Create.

Put the example code on a Compute Engine instance

    In the console, go to Compute Engine > VM Instances.
    SSH into bigquery-instance by clicking on the SSH button.

Note: While connecting to SSH, you can click on Connect without Identity-Aware Proxy.

In the SSH window, install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

*sudo apt-get update

*sudo apt-get install -y git python3-pip

*pip3 install --upgrade pip

*pip3 install google-cloud-bigquery

*pip3 install pyarrow

*pip3 install pandas

*pip3 install db-dtypes

Now create the example Python file:
*echo "
from google.auth import compute_engine
from google.cloud import bigquery
credentials = compute_engine.Credentials(
    service_account_email='YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT')
query = '''
SELECT
  year,
  COUNT(1) as num_babies
FROM
  publicdata.samples.natality
WHERE
  year > 2000
GROUP BY
  year
'''
client = bigquery.Client(
    project='qwiklabs-gcp-03-5a0ee30d5a0d',
    credentials=credentials)
print(client.query(query).to_dataframe())
" > query.py

Add the Project ID to query.py with:

*sed -i -e "s/qwiklabs-gcp-03-5a0ee30d5a0d/$(gcloud config get-value project)/g" query.py

Run the following to make sure that the sed command has successfully changed the Project ID in the file:

*cat query.py

Example output (yours may differ):

from google.auth import compute_engine
from google.cloud import bigquery
credentials = compute_engine.Credentials(
    service_account_email='YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT')
query = '''
SELECT
  year,
  COUNT(1) as num_babies
FROM
  publicdata.samples.natality
WHERE
  year > 2000
GROUP BY
  year
'''
client = bigquery.Client(
    project=qwiklabs-gcp-03-5a0ee30d5a0d,
    credentials=credentials)
print(client.query(query).to_dataframe())

Add the service account email to query.py with:

*sed -i -e "s/YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT/bigquery-qwiklab@$(gcloud config get-value project).iam.gserviceaccount.com/g" query.py

Run the following to make sure that the sed command has successfully changed the service account email in the file:

*cat query.py

Example output (yours may differ):
from google.auth import compute_engine
from google.cloud import bigquery
credentials = compute_engine.Credentials(
    service_account_email='bigquery-qwiklab@qwiklabs-gcp-03-5a0ee30d5a0d.iam.gserviceaccount.com')
query = '''
SELECT
  year,
  COUNT(1) as num_babies
FROM
  publicdata.samples.natality
WHERE
  year > 2000
GROUP BY
  year
'''
client = bigquery.Client(
    project=qwiklabs-gcp-03-5a0ee30d5a0d,
    credentials=credentials)
print(client.query(query).to_dataframe())

The application now uses the permissions that are associated with this service account. Run the query with the following Python command:

*python3 query.py

The query should return the following output (your numbers may vary):



Row year  num_babies
0   2008  4255156
1   2006  4273225
2   2003  4096092
3   2004  4118907
4   2002  4027376
5   2005  4145619
6   2001  4031531
7   2007  4324008
