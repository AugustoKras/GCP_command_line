Verify that the load balancer is deployed and registered by executing the following command:
*gcloud compute backend-services get-health web-backend --global

Retrieve the load balancer IP address by executing the following command:
*gcloud compute forwarding-rules describe web-rule --global

Copy the value for the IPAddress property, later it will be used as [IP_ADDRESS_OF_LOAD_BAL].
35.227.194.130
*while true; do curl -m1 [IP_ADDRESS_OF_LOAD_BAL]; done
*while true; do curl -m1 35.227.194.130; done

The responses will alternate randomly among the instances.
